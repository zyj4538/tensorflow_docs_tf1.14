# tf.contrib.checkpoint.CheckpointableBase

## Class `CheckpointableBase`

Base class for `Trackable` objects without automatic dependencies.





Defined in [`python/training/tracking/base.py`](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/r1.14/tensorflow/python/training/tracking/base.py).

<!-- Placeholder for "Used in" -->

This class has no __setattr__ override for performance reasons. Dependencies
must be added explicitly. Unless attribute assignment is performance-critical,
use `AutoTrackable` instead. Use `Trackable` for `isinstance`
checks.
