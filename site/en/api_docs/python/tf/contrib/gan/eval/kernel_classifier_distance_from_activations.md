<!-- Placeholder for "Used in" -->

This methods computes the kernel classifier distance from activations of
real images and generated images. This can be used independently of the
kernel_classifier_distance() method, especially in the case of using large
batches during evaluation where we would like to precompute all of the
activations before computing the classifier distance, or if we want to
compute multiple metrics based on the same images.

This technique is described in detail in https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.01401.
Given two distributions P and Q of activations, this function calculates

    E_{X, X' ~ P}[k(X, X')] + E_{Y, Y' ~ Q}[k(Y, Y')]
      - 2 E_{X ~ P, Y ~ Q}[k(X, Y)]

where k is the polynomial kernel

    k(x, y) = ( x^T y / dimension + 1 )^3.

This captures how different the distributions of real and generated images'
visual features are. Like the Frechet distance (and unlike the Inception
score), this is a true distance and incorporates information about the
target images. Unlike the Frechet score, this function computes an
*unbiased* and asymptotically normal estimator, which makes comparing
estimates across models much more intuitive.

The estimator used takes time quadratic in max_block_size. Larger values of
max_block_size will decrease the variance of the estimator but increase the
computational cost. This differs slightly from the estimator used by the
original paper; it is the block estimator of https://arxiv.org/abs/1307.1954.

NOTE: the blocking code assumes that real_activations and
generated_activations are both in random order. If either is sorted in a
meaningful order, the estimator will behave poorly.

#### Args:


* <b>`real_activations`</b>: 2D Tensor containing activations of real data. Shape is
  [batch_size, activation_size].
* <b>`generated_activations`</b>: 2D Tensor containing activations of generated data.
  Shape is [batch_size, activation_size].
* <b>`max_block_size`</b>: integer, default 1024. The distance estimator splits samples
  into blocks for computational efficiency. Larger values are more
  computationally expensive but decrease the variance of the distance
  estimate.
* <b>`dtype`</b>: If not None, coerce activations to this dtype before computations.


#### Returns:

The Kernel Inception Distance. A floating-point scalar of the same type
as the output of the activations.
