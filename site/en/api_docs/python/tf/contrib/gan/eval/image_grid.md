# tf.contrib.gan.eval.image_grid

Arrange a minibatch of images into a grid to form a single image.

### Aliases:

* `tf.contrib.gan.eval.eval_utils.image_grid`
* `tf.contrib.gan.eval.image_grid`

``` python
tf.contrib.gan.eval.image_grid(
    input_tensor,
    grid_shape,
    image_shape=(32, 32),
    num_channels=3
)
```

#### Args:


* <b>`input_tensor`</b>: Tensor. Minibatch of images to format, either 4D
    ([batch size, height, width, num_channels]) or flattened
    ([batch size, height * width * num_channels]).
* <b>`grid_shape`</b>: Sequence of int. The shape of the image grid,
    formatted as [grid_height, grid_width].
* <b>`image_shape`</b>: Sequence of int. The shape of a single image,
    formatted as [image_height, image_width].
* <b>`num_channels`</b>: int. The number of channels in an image.


#### Returns:

Tensor representing a single image in which the input images have been
arranged into a grid.



#### Raises:


* <b>`ValueError`</b>: The grid shape and minibatch size don't match, or the image
    shape and number of channels are incompatible with the input tensor.
