# tf.contrib.seq2seq.gather_tree

Calculates the full beams from the per-step ids and parent beam ids.

``` python
tf.contrib.seq2seq.gather_tree(
    step_ids,
    parent_ids,
    max_sequence_lengths,
    end_token,
    name=None
)
```



Defined in generated file: `contrib/seq2seq/ops/gen_beam_search_ops.py`.

<!-- Placeholder for "Used in" -->

On CPU, if an out of bound parent id is found, an error is returned.
On GPU, if an out of bound parent id is found, a -1 is stored in the
corresponding output value and the execution for that beam returns early.

For a given beam, past the time step containing the first decoded `end_token`
all values are filled in with `end_token`.

TODO(ebrevdo): fill in the remainder of this docstring.

#### Args:


* <b>`step_ids`</b>: A `Tensor`. Must be one of the following types: `int32`.
  `[max_time, batch_size, beam_width]`.
* <b>`parent_ids`</b>: A `Tensor`. Must have the same type as `step_ids`.
  `[max_time, batch_size, beam_width]`.
* <b>`max_sequence_lengths`</b>: A `Tensor` of type `int32`. `[batch_size]`.
* <b>`end_token`</b>: A `Tensor`. Must have the same type as `step_ids`. `[]`.
* <b>`name`</b>: A name for the operation (optional).


#### Returns:

A `Tensor`. Has the same type as `step_ids`.
`[max_time, batch_size, beam_width]`.
