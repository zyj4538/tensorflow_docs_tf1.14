# tf.contrib.timeseries.NumpyReader

## Class `NumpyReader`

A time series parser for feeding Numpy arrays to a `TimeSeriesInputFn`.





Defined in [`contrib/timeseries/python/timeseries/input_pipeline.py`](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/r1.14/tensorflow/contrib/timeseries/python/timeseries/input_pipeline.py).

<!-- Placeholder for "Used in" -->

Avoids embedding data in the graph as constants.

<h2 id="__init__"><code>__init__</code></h2>

``` python
__init__(
    data,
    read_num_records_hint=4096
)
```

Numpy array input for a `TimeSeriesInputFn`.


#### Args:


* <b>`data`</b>: A dictionary mapping feature names to Numpy arrays, with two
  possible shapes (requires keys `TrainEvalFeatures.TIMES` and
  `TrainEvalFeatures.VALUES`): Univariate; `TIMES` and `VALUES` are both
    vectors of shape [series length] Multivariate; `TIMES` is a vector of
    shape [series length], `VALUES` has shape [series length x number of
    features]. In any case, `VALUES` and any exogenous features must have
    their shapes prefixed by the shape of the value corresponding to the
    `TIMES` key.
* <b>`read_num_records_hint`</b>: The maximum number of samples to read at one time,
  for efficiency.



## Methods

<h3 id="check_dataset_size"><code>check_dataset_size</code></h3>

``` python
check_dataset_size(minimum_dataset_size)
```

Raise an error if the dataset is too small.


<h3 id="read"><code>read</code></h3>

``` python
read()
```

Returns a large chunk of the Numpy arrays for later re-chunking.


<h3 id="read_full"><code>read_full</code></h3>

``` python
read_full()
```

Returns `Tensor` versions of the full Numpy arrays.
