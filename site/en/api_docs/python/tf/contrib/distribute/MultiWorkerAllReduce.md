# tf.contrib.distribute.MultiWorkerAllReduce

## Class `MultiWorkerAllReduce`

All-reduce algorithms for distributed TensorFlow.

Inherits From: [`AllReduceCrossDeviceOps`](../../../tf/contrib/distribute/AllReduceCrossDeviceOps)



Defined in [`python/distribute/cross_device_ops.py`](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/r1.14/tensorflow/python/distribute/cross_device_ops.py).

<!-- Placeholder for "Used in" -->


<h2 id="__init__"><code>__init__</code></h2>

``` python
__init__(
    worker_devices,
    num_gpus_per_worker,
    all_reduce_spec=('pscpu/pscpu', 2, -1),
    num_packs=0,
    agg_small_grads_max_bytes=0,
    agg_small_grads_max_group=10
)
```

Initialize the all-reduce algorithm.


#### Args:


* <b>`worker_devices`</b>: a list of device strings for workers participating in
  all-reduce.
* <b>`num_gpus_per_worker`</b>: number of GPU devices per worker.
* <b>`all_reduce_spec`</b>: a tuple or a named tuple or a list of tuples specifying
  the all-reduce algorithm.
  1. The first element of a tuple is the name of the all-reduce algorithm.
  Valid algorithm names are: "nccl", "nccl/xring", "nccl/rechd",
  "nccl/pscpu", "xring", "pscpu", "psgpu", "pscpu/pscpu". Algorithms with
  a "/" are hierarchical, so two all-reduces are executed, the first one
  aggregates tensors within a worker and the second aggregates across
  workers.
  2. The second element of a tuple is the number of shards when doing
  all-reduce. Let's say its values is M, each tensor after packing will be
  split into M shards and then M parallel all-reduces would be performed
  before finally they are concatenated backed into a complete tensor.
  3. The third element is the maximum size of tensors that will be
  applicable for the algorithm specified by the first element. For
  example, if all_reduce_spec=[("nccl", 2, 1024), ("pscpu/pscpu", 2, -1)],
  tensors with size not larger than 1024 bytes will be applied a 2-shard
  "nccl" all-reduce and other tensors will be applied a 2-shard
  "pscpu/pscpu" algorithm. The third elements should be in increasing
  order across tuples and end with -1 which indicates infinity.

## Methods

<h3 id="batch_reduce"><code>batch_reduce</code></h3>

``` python
batch_reduce(
    reduce_op,
    value_destination_pairs
)
```

Reduce PerReplica objects in a batch.

Reduce each first element in `value_destination_pairs` to each second
element which indicates the destinations.

#### Args:


* <b>`reduce_op`</b>: Indicates how per_replica_value will be reduced. Accepted
  values are <a href="../../../tf/distribute/ReduceOp#SUM"><code>tf.distribute.ReduceOp.SUM</code></a>, <a href="../../../tf/distribute/ReduceOp#MEAN"><code>tf.distribute.ReduceOp.MEAN</code></a>.
* <b>`value_destination_pairs`</b>: a list or a tuple of tuples of PerReplica objects
  (or tensors with device set if there is one device) and destinations.


#### Returns:

a list of Mirrored objects.



#### Raises:


* <b>`ValueError`</b>: if `value_destination_pairs` is not a list or a tuple of
  tuples of PerReplica objects and destinations

<h3 id="broadcast"><code>broadcast</code></h3>

``` python
broadcast(
    tensor,
    destinations
)
```

Broadcast the `tensor` to destinations.


#### Args:


* <b>`tensor`</b>: the tensor to broadcast.
* <b>`destinations`</b>: the broadcast destinations.


#### Returns:

a Mirrored object.


<h3 id="reduce"><code>reduce</code></h3>

``` python
reduce(
    reduce_op,
    per_replica_value,
    destinations
)
```

Reduce `per_replica_value` to `destinations`.

It runs the reduction operation defined by `reduce_op` and put the
result on `destinations`.

#### Args:


* <b>`reduce_op`</b>: Indicates how per_replica_value will be reduced. Accepted
  values are <a href="../../../tf/distribute/ReduceOp#SUM"><code>tf.distribute.ReduceOp.SUM</code></a>, <a href="../../../tf/distribute/ReduceOp#MEAN"><code>tf.distribute.ReduceOp.MEAN</code></a>.
* <b>`per_replica_value`</b>: a PerReplica object or a tensor with device set.
* <b>`destinations`</b>: the reduction destinations.


#### Returns:

a Mirrored object.



#### Raises:


* <b>`ValueError`</b>: if per_replica_value can't be converted to a PerReplica
  object.
