# tf.train.GlobalStepWaiterHook

## Class `GlobalStepWaiterHook`

Delays execution until global step reaches `wait_until_step`.

Inherits From: [`SessionRunHook`](../../tf/train/SessionRunHook)

### Aliases:

* Class `tf.compat.v1.estimator.GlobalStepWaiterHook`
* Class `tf.compat.v1.train.GlobalStepWaiterHook`
* Class `tf.compat.v2.estimator.GlobalStepWaiterHook`
* Class `tf.estimator.GlobalStepWaiterHook`
* Class `tf.train.GlobalStepWaiterHook`



Defined in [`python/training/basic_session_run_hooks.py`](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/r1.14/tensorflow/python/training/basic_session_run_hooks.py).

<!-- Placeholder for "Used in" -->

This hook delays execution until global step reaches to `wait_until_step`. It
is used to gradually start workers in distributed settings. One example usage
would be setting `wait_until_step=int(K*log(task_id+1))` assuming that
task_id=0 is the chief.

<h2 id="__init__"><code>__init__</code></h2>

``` python
__init__(wait_until_step)
```

Initializes a `GlobalStepWaiterHook`.


#### Args:


* <b>`wait_until_step`</b>: an `int` shows until which global step should we wait.



## Methods

<h3 id="after_create_session"><code>after_create_session</code></h3>

``` python
after_create_session(
    session,
    coord
)
```

Called when new TensorFlow session is created.

This is called to signal the hooks that a new session has been created. This
has two essential differences with the situation in which `begin` is called:

* When this is called, the graph is finalized and ops can no longer be added
    to the graph.
* This method will also be called as a result of recovering a wrapped
    session, not only at the beginning of the overall session.

#### Args:


* <b>`session`</b>: A TensorFlow Session that has been created.
* <b>`coord`</b>: A Coordinator object which keeps track of all threads.

<h3 id="after_run"><code>after_run</code></h3>

``` python
after_run(
    run_context,
    run_values
)
```

Called after each call to run().

The `run_values` argument contains results of requested ops/tensors by
`before_run()`.

The `run_context` argument is the same one send to `before_run` call.
`run_context.request_stop()` can be called to stop the iteration.

If `session.run()` raises any exceptions then `after_run()` is not called.

#### Args:


* <b>`run_context`</b>: A `SessionRunContext` object.
* <b>`run_values`</b>: A SessionRunValues object.

<h3 id="before_run"><code>before_run</code></h3>

``` python
before_run(run_context)
```




<h3 id="begin"><code>begin</code></h3>

``` python
begin()
```




<h3 id="end"><code>end</code></h3>

``` python
end(session)
```

Called at the end of session.

The `session` argument can be used in case the hook wants to run final ops,
such as saving a last checkpoint.

If `session.run()` raises exception other than OutOfRangeError or
StopIteration then `end()` is not called.
Note the difference between `end()` and `after_run()` behavior when
`session.run()` raises OutOfRangeError or StopIteration. In that case
`end()` is called but `after_run()` is not called.

#### Args:


* <b>`session`</b>: A TensorFlow Session that will be soon closed.
