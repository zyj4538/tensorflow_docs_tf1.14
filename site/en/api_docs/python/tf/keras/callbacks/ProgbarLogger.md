# tf.keras.callbacks.ProgbarLogger

## Class `ProgbarLogger`

Callback that prints metrics to stdout.

Inherits From: [`Callback`](../../../tf/keras/callbacks/Callback)

### Aliases:

* Class `tf.compat.v1.keras.callbacks.ProgbarLogger`
* Class `tf.compat.v2.keras.callbacks.ProgbarLogger`
* Class `tf.keras.callbacks.ProgbarLogger`



Defined in [`python/keras/callbacks.py`](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/r1.14/tensorflow/python/keras/callbacks.py).

<!-- Placeholder for "Used in" -->


#### Arguments:


* <b>`count_mode`</b>: One of "steps" or "samples".
    Whether the progress bar should
    count samples seen or steps (batches) seen.
* <b>`stateful_metrics`</b>: Iterable of string names of metrics that
    should *not* be averaged over an epoch.
    Metrics in this list will be logged as-is.
    All others will be averaged over time (e.g. loss, etc).


#### Raises:


* <b>`ValueError`</b>: In case of invalid `count_mode`.
