# tf.keras.callbacks.LearningRateScheduler

## Class `LearningRateScheduler`

Learning rate scheduler.

Inherits From: [`Callback`](../../../tf/keras/callbacks/Callback)

### Aliases:

* Class `tf.compat.v1.keras.callbacks.LearningRateScheduler`
* Class `tf.compat.v2.keras.callbacks.LearningRateScheduler`
* Class `tf.keras.callbacks.LearningRateScheduler`



Defined in [`python/keras/callbacks.py`](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/r1.14/tensorflow/python/keras/callbacks.py).

<!-- Placeholder for "Used in" -->


#### Arguments:


* <b>`schedule`</b>: a function that takes an epoch index as input
    (integer, indexed from 0) and returns a new
    learning rate as output (float).
* <b>`verbose`</b>: int. 0: quiet, 1: update messages.

```python
# This function keeps the learning rate at 0.001 for the first ten epochs
# and decreases it exponentially after that.
def scheduler(epoch):
  if epoch < 10:
    return 0.001
  else:
    return 0.001 * tf.math.exp(0.1 * (10 - epoch))

callback = tf.keras.callbacks.LearningRateScheduler(scheduler)
model.fit(data, labels, epochs=100, callbacks=[callback],
          validation_data=(val_data, val_labels))
```
