# tf.keras.callbacks.RemoteMonitor

## Class `RemoteMonitor`

Callback used to stream events to a server.

Inherits From: [`Callback`](../../../tf/keras/callbacks/Callback)

### Aliases:

* Class `tf.compat.v1.keras.callbacks.RemoteMonitor`
* Class `tf.compat.v2.keras.callbacks.RemoteMonitor`
* Class `tf.keras.callbacks.RemoteMonitor`



Defined in [`python/keras/callbacks.py`](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/r1.14/tensorflow/python/keras/callbacks.py).

<!-- Placeholder for "Used in" -->

Requires the `requests` library.
Events are sent to `root + '/publish/epoch/end/'` by default. Calls are
HTTP POST, with a `data` argument which is a
JSON-encoded dictionary of event data.
If send_as_json is set to True, the content type of the request will be
application/json. Otherwise the serialized JSON will be sent within a form.

#### Arguments:


* <b>`root`</b>: String; root url of the target server.
* <b>`path`</b>: String; path relative to `root` to which the events will be sent.
* <b>`field`</b>: String; JSON field under which the data will be stored.
    The field is used only if the payload is sent within a form
    (i.e. send_as_json is set to False).
* <b>`headers`</b>: Dictionary; optional custom HTTP headers.
* <b>`send_as_json`</b>: Boolean; whether the request should be
    sent as application/json.
