# tf.keras.callbacks.BaseLogger

## Class `BaseLogger`

Callback that accumulates epoch averages of metrics.

Inherits From: [`Callback`](../../../tf/keras/callbacks/Callback)

### Aliases:

* Class `tf.compat.v1.keras.callbacks.BaseLogger`
* Class `tf.compat.v2.keras.callbacks.BaseLogger`
* Class `tf.keras.callbacks.BaseLogger`



Defined in [`python/keras/callbacks.py`](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/r1.14/tensorflow/python/keras/callbacks.py).

<!-- Placeholder for "Used in" -->

This callback is automatically applied to every Keras model.

#### Arguments:


* <b>`stateful_metrics`</b>: Iterable of string names of metrics that
    should *not* be averaged over an epoch.
    Metrics in this list will be logged as-is in `on_epoch_end`.
    All others will be averaged in `on_epoch_end`.

<h2 id="__init__"><code>__init__</code></h2>

``` python
__init__(stateful_metrics=None)
```
