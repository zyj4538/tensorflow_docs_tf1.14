# tf.keras.callbacks.CSVLogger

## Class `CSVLogger`

Callback that streams epoch results to a csv file.

Inherits From: [`Callback`](../../../tf/keras/callbacks/Callback)

### Aliases:

* Class `tf.compat.v1.keras.callbacks.CSVLogger`
* Class `tf.compat.v2.keras.callbacks.CSVLogger`
* Class `tf.keras.callbacks.CSVLogger`



Defined in [`python/keras/callbacks.py`](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/r1.14/tensorflow/python/keras/callbacks.py).

<!-- Placeholder for "Used in" -->

Supports all values that can be represented as a string,
including 1D iterables such as np.ndarray.

#### Example:



```python
csv_logger = CSVLogger('training.log')
model.fit(X_train, Y_train, callbacks=[csv_logger])
```

#### Arguments:


* <b>`filename`</b>: filename of the csv file, e.g. 'run/log.csv'.
* <b>`separator`</b>: string used to separate elements in the csv file.
* <b>`append`</b>: True: append if file exists (useful for continuing
    training). False: overwrite existing file,

``` python
__init__(
    filename,
    separator=',',
    append=False
)
```






## Methods

<h3 id="on_batch_begin"><code>on_batch_begin</code></h3>

``` python
on_batch_begin(
    batch,
    logs=None
)
```

A backwards compatibility alias for `on_train_batch_begin`.


<h3 id="on_batch_end"><code>on_batch_end</code></h3>

``` python
on_batch_end(
    batch,
    logs=None
)
```

A backwards compatibility alias for `on_train_batch_end`.
